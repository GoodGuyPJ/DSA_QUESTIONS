// Stack - Stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows adding and removing elements from the top of the stack only. The stack is implemented using a linked list, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The stack has two main operations: push (to add an element) and pop (to remove an element). The stack can also be checked for emptiness and can return the top element without removing it.

// push - Adds an element to the top of the stack
// pop - Removes the top element from the stack
// top - Returns the top element of the stack without removing it
// empty - Checks if the stack is empty
// size - Returns the number of elements in the stack
